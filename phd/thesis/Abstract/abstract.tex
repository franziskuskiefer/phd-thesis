\begin{abstract}
Password-based authentication is the most popular authentication mechanisms for humans today, not only on the internet.
Despite increasing efforts to move to more secure alternatives, password-based authentication is most likely to stay for the foreseeable future due to its user experience and convenience.
However, although secure cryptographic protocols for password-based authentication and key-exchange exist, they are hardly used in practice.
Previous work on password-based cryptography include secure password-based key-exchange, authentication, and secret sharing protocols.

This thesis sets out to bring cryptographic password-based protocols closer to real world deployment as well as improving their security guarantees.
To this end it proposes frameworks for password-based authentication and key-exchange in the verifier and two-server setting as a step towards deploying cryptographically secure password-based protocols.
These frameworks do not only include the authentication/key-exchange step, which has been researched before, but also considers password registration, which has not been examined before.
