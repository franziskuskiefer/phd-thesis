\chapter{Password-based Authentication in the Two-Party Setting}
Using passwords for authentication is it's most common use case.
As discussed in the introduction, this is still done with the inherently flawed approach of \ac{HTML}-over-\ac{TLS} despite the existence of secure \ac{PAKE} protocols.
In this section we propose new mechanisms to register user accounts with secure password policy checks and give a new verifier-based \ac{PAKE} protocol to authenticate with these accounts.

This chapter is based on work in \cite{KieferM14b,KieferM15a,DongK15a,ManulisSKD15a}.
