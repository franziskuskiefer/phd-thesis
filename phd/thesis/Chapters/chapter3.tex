\chapter[A Password Authentication Framework for the Single-Server Setting]{A Password-based Authentication Framework for the Single-Server Setting} \label{ch:vpake}

Using passwords for authentication is it's most common use case.
As discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:intro} this is usually done with the inherently flawed approach of password-over-\ac{HTML} despite the existence of more secure alternatives such as \ac{PAKE}.
In this chapter we propose the first framework for cryptographic password registration and authentication.
The framework comprises a protocol for clients to register passwords in a secure way with a server while still allowing for password policies checks, as well as suitable protocols to use the password verifier for password-based authentication.

The first main contribution in this chapter is the definition of \acl{BPR}.
This protocol class allows a client to register a password verifier with a server without actually disclosing the password, while allowing the server to check the password's policy compliance against his password policy.
Note that this still requires a secure channel (established using for example \ac{TLS}) between client and server.
This requirement can not be removed as obtaining the password verifier eventually always leads to password disclosure.
However, this is not the goal of \ac{BPR}.
Instead, \ac{BPR} offers a way of removing the trust assumption that the server securely handles client passwords by never revealing the actual password to the server.

Using registered password verifiers to authenticate clients are the second step of the proposed framework, which can be performed using \ac{VPAKE} or \ac{tPAuth} protocols.
While \ac{VPAKE} is the first natural way of authenticating using a password on the client side and a password verifier on the server side, \ac{tPAuth} protocols can be used with verifiers as well and are more suitable for password based authentication on the web.

\paragraph{Outline}
This chapter comprises 9 sections organised as follows.
Section \ref{sec:passwords} gives definitions of passwords, dictionaries, and policies, used in this chapter and Section \ref{sec:strucphash} describes a novel password hashing algorithm.
Methods introduced in these first two sections allow us to convert character strings to elements usable for cryptographic operations.
Section \ref{sec:zkppc} introduces the notion of \ac{ZKPPC} and how it can be used to build password registration protocols from it.
The resulting notion of \ac{BPR} is formalised in the subsequent Section \ref{sec:bpr} giving a security model and an efficient protocol.
Section \ref{sec:spc-bpr} introduces an alternative approach to \ac{BPR}.
To compare the different \ac{BPR} approaches Section \ref{sec:performance} provides implementations for all three approaches and gives a comparison of the protocols and security guarantees.
This concludes the password registration step of the framework.
To use passwords registered with the \ac{BPR} protocols described in Section \ref{sec:zkppc}-\ref{sec:spc-bpr}, Sections \ref{sec:pake} discusses and proposes appropriate \ac{PAKE} and \ac{VPAKE} protocols.
The chapter is concluded by the description of an online demo for the proposed framework in Section \ref{sec:vpake-demo} and Section \ref{sec:vpake-conclusion} to summarise the results of this chapter.
