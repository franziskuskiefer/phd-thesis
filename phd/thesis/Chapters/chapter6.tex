\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ch:conclusion}

This thesis proposed two novel frameworks for password registration and authentication.
The first framework is based in the verifier-based (single-server) setting and allows a client to register a password verifier with a server without disclosing the actual password, while preserving the server's ability to check policy compliance of the password that is hidden in the password verifier.
We proposed three protocols with according security models to achieve this.
To use the password together with the registered password verifier we discussed and proposed new \ac{VPAKE} protocols usable with the registered verifiers.
The second framework is based in the two-server setting and allows a client to register password shares on two servers while preserving the server's ability to verify that the client's password is policy compliant.
We proposed an efficient protocol with according security model to achieve this.
To use the registered password shares in a \ac{2PAKE} protocol for authentication we propose the first \ac{2PAKE} framework as well as the first \ac{UC} secure \ac{2PAKE} protocol.
To this end we introduced new notions for smooth projective hashing, \ie \acl{D-SPHF} and \acl{TD-SPHF}, that allow distributed computation of \acp{SPHF}.
