\chapter{Password-based Authentication in the Three-Party Setting}

While \ac{PAKE} solves one of the most pressing problems in user authentication, it is still vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks once the server is compromised.
To alleviate the impact of password leaks on the server threshold \ac{PAKE} has been proposed.
However, research in this area is rather limited compared to the single-server case.
This chapter proposes a complete framework to use two-server \ac{PAKE} for user authentication, consisting of a blind password registration protocol and a \ac{UC}-secure two-server \ac{PAKE} protocol.

This chapter is based on work in \cite{KieferM14b,KieferM15b,KieferM15c}.
