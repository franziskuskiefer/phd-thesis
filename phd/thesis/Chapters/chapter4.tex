\chapter{Password Authentication Framework in the Two-Server Setting} \label{ch:2pake}

While \ac{PAKE} and \ac{VPAKE} solve one of the most pressing problems in user authentication they are still vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks once the server is compromised.
To alleviate the impact of password leaks on the server threshold \ac{PAKE} has been proposed.
However, research in this area is rather limited compared to the single-server case.
This chapter proposes a framework for the two-server setting, similar to the framework from Chapter \ref{ch:vpake}, which uses \ac{2PAKE} for user authentication and a \ac{2BPR} protocol for password share registration.
We further propose a new security model for two \ac{2PAKE} protocols in the \ac{UC} model.

This chapter is based on work in \cite{KieferM14b,KieferM15b,KieferM15c}.

\paragraph{Introduction}

Considering that ``password-cracking tools'' such as Hashcat \cite{hashcat} and John the Ripper \cite{JohnTheRipper} are very efficient, it is reasonable to assume that leaking password hashes is more or less equivalent to leaking passwords \cite{NarayananS05a,WeirAMG09,DellAmicoMR10,Bonneau12}.
The notion of threshold and two-server password authenticated key-exchange \cite{FordK00,MacKenzieSJ02} has been proposed where the password is not stored on a single server but split between a number of servers such that leakage of a password database on a non-qualified subset does not reveal the password.
The two-server setting is regarded as more practical (in comparison to a more general threshold setting) given that if one server is compromised a notification to change the password can be sent out to the clients.
\ac{2PAKE} protocols \cite{BrainardJKS03,SzydloK05,Katz2012a} split the client's password $\pwd$ into two shares $\share_1$ and $\share_2$ such that each share is stored on a distinct server.
During the authentication phase both servers collaborate in order to authenticate the client.
Yet, no server alone is supposed to learn the plain password.
A second, more recent development in two-server (and threshold) password protocols is \ac{PPSS} \cite{Bagherzandi2011,Camenisch2012,JareckiKK14} where a client stores shares of a (high-entropy) secret key on a number of servers and uses a (low-entropy) password to authenticate the retrieval process.

Registering password shares for \ac{2PAKE}/\ac{PPSS} protocols however makes it impossible for the servers to verify their password policies upon registration unless the password is transferred to each of them in plain. 
This however, would imply that the client trusts both servers to securely handle the password, which contradicts the purpose and trust relationships of multi-server protocols.
The use of two-server password protocols in a remote authentication setting, therefore, requires a suitable password registration procedure in which none of the servers would receive information enabling it (or an attacker in control of the server) to deliberately or inadvertently recover the client's password.
This registration procedure must further allow for policy compliance checks to be performed by the servers since secret sharing does not protect against weak passwords.
A trivial approach of sending $\share_1$ and $\share_2$ to the corresponding servers over secure channels is not helpful here since it is not clear how the two servers can perform the required compliance check.

The concept of blind password registration for two-server password protocols proposed as first step in this chapter shows how to realise secure registration of password shares in a way that protects against at most one malicious server (if both servers are malicious, the attacker obviously gets the password), yet allows both servers to check password compliance against their mutual password policy.
\ac{2BPR} is not vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks as long as one server remains honest.
This is in contrast to the single-server setting where an attacker is always able to perform offline dictionary attacks on password verifiers after compromising a server. 

The second step in the framework can either be a \ac{2PAKE} or a two-server \ac{PPSS} protocol.
We show how to use password shares set up with the \ac{2BPR} protocol to authenticate the client.
Further, we propose a new framework for \ac{2PAKE} protocols that leads to a new security model for \ac{2PAKE} protocols in the \ac{UC} model.

%password BPR protocol
% Our main contribution is the 2BPR security model and the corresponding protocol for secure registration of 2PAKE/2PASS passwords. We show how secure distribution of password shares can be combined with an appropriate policy-compliance proof for the chosen password in a way that does not reveal the password and can still be verified by both servers.
% Our 2BPR protocol can be used to enforce policies over the alphabet of all 94 printable ASCII characters, including typical requirements on password length and character types.

% \paragraph{Two-Server Password Authenticated Key Exchange}

% \ac{PAKE} protocols have been extensively researched over the last twenty years.
% They allow two protocol participants, holding a low-entropy secret (password) each, to negotiate an authenticated session key.
% Several security models have been developed including the well-known game-based notion from Bellare, Pointcheval and Rogaway \cite{Bellare2000,Abdalla2005a} and a notion in the universal composability (UC) framework \cite{Canetti2005}.
% While PAKE protocols can be executed between two humans holding the same password, they are usually considered in a client, server scenario where the client registers with a server that then stores the password and uses it in subsequent sessions to authenticate the client.
% This approach however leads to an intrinsic weakness regarding server compromise.
% As soon as a server, storing client passwords is compromised the attacker learns the passwords.
% This allows the attacker to log into the client's account on the server and most likely also on others if the client re-used the password across multiple servers.
% Mechanisms have been proposed to solve the problem of server compromise.
% In particular verifier-based PAKE \cite{Gentry2006,rfc2945,BenhamoudaP13}, also known as augmented PAKE \cite{BellovinM93}, considers an asymmetric setting in which the server uses a function of the password (verifier) to verify a client holding the corresponding password.
% However, as long as only one server is used, PAKE protocols are prone to offline dictionary attacks on the server side, i.e. server attacks still leak password verifiers that allow to recover the password, which is rather efficiently with current methods \cite{hashcat,JohnTheRipper}.

% \ac{2PAKE} protocols solve the problem of offline dictionary attacks in the case of server compromise by splitting the password in two parts such that a malicious or compromised server can only recover a password share that does not allow to recover the password.
% % In contrast to \ac{PAKE} protocols \ac{2PAKE} protocols are less well studied.
% % 2PAKE can be seen as a special case for $t=n=2$ of threshold PAKE where $t$ out of $n$ servers, participating in the protocol and holding a password share, must be honest.
% \citet{RaimondoG03} and \citet{MacKenzieSJ02} were among the firsts to propose t-out-of-n password authenticated key exchange protocols.
% The former is not suitable for \ac{2PAKE} as it needs $t<n/3$ while the latter requires a PKI in addition to the password.
% The first real two-server PAKE protocol is due to Brainard and Jules \cite{Brainard_Juels_2003}, which was proven secure by Szydlo and Kaliski \cite{SzydloK05} in a modified version.
% The first two server PAKE with thorough security model based on the classical game-based BPR model is due to Katz, MacKenzie,  Taban and Gligor \cite{KatzMTB05}, which was recently generalised to a two-server PAKE framework by Kiefer and Manulis \cite{KieferM14a}.
% Threshold and two-server password authenticated key exchange is closely related to password authenticated secret sharing (PASS).
% Password authenticated secret sharing was first proposed as password protected secret sharing by Bagherzandi, Jarecki, Saxena and Lu in 2011 \cite{Bagherzandi2011} and gained a lot of attention since then \cite{Camenisch_Lysyanskaya_Neven_2012,JareckiKK14,CamenishEN15}.
% As shown in \cite{JareckiKK14} PASS can also be used to implement efficient threshold PAKE protocols.
% While using the universally composability framework to prove security of the PASS primitive, none of these papers give a threshold or two-server PAKE protocol secure in UC.
%
% In this work we propose the first notion of UC security for two-server PAKE protocols and give an efficient protocol in the standard model with common reference string and static corruptions.
% To this end we leverage recent advancements of smooth projective hashing in the two-server setting from \cite{KieferM14a} and in efficiency from \cite{Benhamouda2013}.
