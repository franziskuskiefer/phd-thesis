\section{Password Authenticated Key Exchange for BPR}\label{sec:pake}

Password verifiers \ver, set up with one of the three password registration protocols proposed in the previous sections, can be used by the server to authenticate a user based on his password \pwd.
To this end this section describes \ac{VPAKE} protocols that can be used with each verifier \ver.
This concludes the password registration and authentication framework, proposed in this chapter.

\subsection{Building VPAKE from PAKE}
Before specifying concrete \ac{VPAKE} protocols we want to discuss a general way of constructing a \ac{VPAKE} protocols from any \ac{PAKE}.
This provides significantly more \ac{VPAKE} protocols due to the large number of \ac{PAKE} protocols than would be available otherwise.
Note that the approach proposed here is widely used but has never been written down as such to the best of our knowledge.

Figure \ref{fig:genericVPAKE} gives an overview of the approach.
Recall that a verifier \ver contains two parts, some randomness $r$ and some kind of hash value $H$ that can be computed from the client's password \pwd and randomness $r$.
In order to use verifier \ver for authentication, the client requires randomness $r$.
After sending $r$ to the client, he can compute \ver, which can then be used any regular \ac{PAKE} protocol instead of the password.

\paragraph{Discussion -- Practical Implications}
Sending verifier randomness to the client obviously exposes this randomness to an attacker.
While transport could be secured with another protocol such as \ac{TLS}, this is not desirable in the \ac{PAKE} setting.
(Would be fine though in the \ac{PACCE} setting.)
Exposing (secret) randomness to an attacker is in general a security risk, as this provides the attacker with leverage.
However, in terms of dictionary attacks, an attacker does not gain anything by this additional knowledge, as he is always able to either perform an online dictionary attack against the server, or and offline dictionary attack after corrupting the server.

\subsection{PAKE for SPC-based BPR}
In order to use a password registered with our protocol for authentication, we require an appropriate password-based authentication or authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol.
%While verifier-based (aka augmented) key exchange has been proposed \cite{BellovinM93,BenhamoudaP13}, its benefit is marginal.
In this section we show how to use the verifier $\ver$ in a common PAKE protocol. The approach we describe here is general and can be used with any PAKE protocol.

% The general approach is as follows.
At the beginning of the authentication process, for a given client identifier the server retrieves the corresponding verifier $\ver=(h, e, N)$ from the database and returns $(e,N)$ to the client.
Using $(e,N)$ and the password \pwd, the client can recompute all $u_i$ values and thus $h'\gets H_3(u_{v+1}^e\cdot\prod_{i=1}^{v}u_i)$ as described earlier.
Note that depending on the used PAKE protocol we have to ensure that $H_3$ maps into an algebraic structure, suitable for use with the PAKE protocol.
Now client and server run any PAKE protocol on password hash $h$. The password hash $h$ retains information about individual characters as well as the order of characters in the password. The first is easy to see since $h$ is computed from the product of blinded characters in the password.  
To see the second, recall that each $u_i=H_2(c_i)\cdot r_i^e$ where $r_i=f_k(i)$, which is a pseudorandom number generated under a key $k$. 
The key $k$ is derived from the password string $k\gets H_1(\pwd)$. 
We must also stress that recomputing the password hash involves public key operations and thus is relatively slow.
However, this is an advantage rather than a shortcoming. 
The increased work, necessary to compute verifier \ver, can effectively increase work load for dictionary attack. 
It is also possible to use a standard key derivation function such as PBKDF2 \cite{rfc2898} as $H_1$ so that the key is derived by repeatedly applying a pseudorandom function and the added work load makes dictionary attack even more difficult.

Because of the way the verifier is structured, in the authentication the server needs to send an additional message, the RSA public key $(e,N)$, to the client. Often we can piggyback the messages in the PAKE protocol to avoid increasing communication round. 
For example, if we use the UC-secure PAKE protocol from \citet{Benhamouda2013}, the RSA public key $(e,N)$ can be piggybacked on the server's message sent in the PAKE protocol. Thus we do not increase the round complexity and the protocol remains a one-round protocol.

\subsection{A New VPAKE Protocol} \label{sec:vpake}
% \section{VPAKE Protocols for ZKPPC-registered Passwords}\label{sec:vpake}
We now focus on suitable VPAKE protocols where the server $\bm{S}$ using $(id, H, r)$ stored from the ZKPPC-based registration protocol can authenticate the client $\bm{C}$ that uses only its $\pwd$. 
Such protocols can be constructed with a general VPAKE framework introduced by Benhamouda and Pointcheval \cite{BenhamoudaP13}. 
Their framework constructs one-round VPAKE protocols with $\bm{C}$ and $\bm{S}$ sending one message each, independently, using a generic password hashing scheme $\Pi=(\PSetup,\allowbreak\PPHSalt,\allowbreak\PPreHash,\PHSalt,\allowbreak\PHash)$ with deterministic $\PPreHash$, labeled public key encryption scheme $\E = (\KGen,\allowbreak \Enc, \Dec)$, and secure SPHFs $(\HKGen,\allowbreak\PKGen,\allowbreak\Hash,\allowbreak\ProjHash)$ for two languages $L_H = \{(\ell, C) | \exists r : C = \Enc^\ell(pk, H; r)\}$ and $L_{s,H}  = \{(\ell, C) | \exists P, \exists r : C = \Enc^\ell(pk, H; r)\ \wedge\ H = \PHash(\paramP,\allowbreak P, s)\}$. 
Their approach can directly be used for our generic scheme $\Pi$ with randomised $\PPreHash$ if we assume that $L_{s,H}$ is defined using $s=(s_P,s_H)$. 
This readily gives us a generic VPAKE protocol that is suitable for our general ZKPPC construction for ASCII-based passwords in Figure~\ref{fig:zkpconeserver} and those security follows from the analysis of the framework in \cite{BenhamoudaP13}.

For the concrete VPAKE construction based on our scheme $\Pi$ from Section~\ref{sec:pwhashped} we can use labeled CS encryption scheme for $\E$ from Section~\ref{sec:prelims}. 
The common input of $\bm{C}$ and $\bm{S}$ contains the CS public key $\pk=(p,g_1,g_2,h,c,d,H_k)$, where generators $g_1=g$ and $h$ must be the same as in the ZKPPC protocol from Section~\ref{sec:instantiation}. 
Since $H=(H_1,H_2)$ we need to slightly update the language $L_H = \{(\ell, C) | \exists r : C = \Enc^\ell(pk, H_2; r)\}$ by using $H_2$ as an encrypted message. 
We can still use the SPHF for CS ciphertexts from Section~\ref{sec:pwhashped} to handle this $L_H$. 
Since the pre-hash salt $s_P$ is not transmitted in the registration phase, i.e. $\bm{S}$ stores $(id, H, s_H)$ where $H=(H_1, H_2)$ with $H_1=g_1^{s_P}$ and $H_2 = H_1^\pi h^{s_H}$, we replace $L_{s,H}$ with the following language $L_{s_H,H} = \{(\ell, C) | \exists \pi, \exists r : C = \Enc^\ell(pk, g_1^\pi; r)\ \wedge\ H_2 = H_1^\pi h^{s_H}\}$ and construct a suitable SPHF for $L_{s_H,H}$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\HKGen(L_{s_H,H})$ generates $\hk=(\eta_1,\eta_2,\theta,\mu,\nu)\rin\ZZ_p^{1\times 5}$.

	\item $\PKGen(\hk,L_{s_H,H})$ derives $\hp=(\hpp{1},\hpp{2},\hpp{3})=(g_1^{\eta_1}g_2^{\theta}h^\mu c^\nu, g_1^{\eta_2}d^\nu, g_1^\mu H_1^{-\mu})$.

	\item $\Hash(\hk,L_{s_H,H},C)$ outputs hash value $h=u_1^{\eta_1+\xi\eta_2}u_2^{\theta}[e/(H_2h^{-s_H})]^\mu v^\nu$.

	\item $\ProjHash(\hp,L_{s_H,H},C,\pi,r)$ outputs hash value \[h=(\hpp{1}\hpp{2}^\xi)^r\hpp{3}^{\pi}=g_1^{\eta_1r}g_2^{\theta r}h^{\mu r} c^{\nu r}g_1^{\eta_2\xi r}d^{\nu\xi r}(g_1^\mu H_1^{-\mu})^{\pi}.\]
\end{itemize}
Note that projection key $\hp$ depends on $H_1\in G$, which can be seen as a parameter in the definition of $L_{s_H,H}$, but $\hp$ does not depend on $C$. The resulting VPAKE protocol can thus still proceed in one round. 
The smoothness of our SPHF construction for $L_{s_H,H}$ can be proven as follows. 
Let $\pi\gets\pwdint(\pwd)$, $H_2 = H_1^\pi h^{s_H}$, with $H_1=g_1^{s_P}$ for some unknown $s_P$, and $(\ell,C=(u_1,u_2,e,v))\not\in L_{s_H,H}$, i.e. $C\gets\Enc^\ell(pk,g_1^{\pi^\ast};r)$ for some $\pi^\ast\not=\pi$. 
Assuming the second pre-image resistance of $\Pi$ it follows that $(u_1, u_1^\xi, u_2, e/(H_2h^{-s_H}), v) \not= (g_1^r, g_1^{r\xi}, g_2^r, g_1^{\pi-s_P\pi}h^r,$ $(cd^\xi)^r)$ with overwhelming probability for all $(r,r\xi)\in\ZZ_p^2$. 
Since $(\hpp{1},\hpp{2},\hpp{3})$ are linearly independent the resulting hash value $h= u_1^{\eta_1} u_1^{\xi\eta_2} u_2^\theta [e/(H_2h^{-s_H})]^\mu v^\nu$ is uniformly distributed in $G$. 
%Pseudorandomness of the correctly produced hash value $h$ follows from the pseudorandomness and the CCA2 security of the used Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme.

\caption{A VPAKE Protocol for Blindly Registered ASCII-based Passwords}
\label{fig:vpakeprotocol}
\end{figure}


Our concrete VPAKE construction is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:vpakeprotocol}. 
We assume that $\bm{C}$ uses $\pi\gets\pwdint(\pwd)$ as its input and has already sent its login name $id$ to $\bm{S}$ who picked the corresponding tuple $(id,H,s_H)$ from its password database. 
Note that $\bm{C}$ can also act as initiator and send its $id$ as part of its message, in which case $\bm{S}$ must act as a responder. 
Which SPHF algorithms $\HKGen$, $\PKGen$, $\Hash$, $\ProjHash$ are used by $\bm{C}$ and $\bm{S}$ is visible from the input language, either $L_H$ or $L_{s_H,H}$. 
By inspection one can see that if both $\bm{C}$ and $\bm{S}$ follow the protocol and $H$ used on the server side is a password hash of $\pi$ used on the client side then both parties compute the same (secret) group element $K=K_1\cdot K_2$. 
Note that $\bm{C}$ derives $K_1$ using its own hashing key $\hk$ and received server's CS ciphertext $C'$ that encrypts $H_2$, whereas $\bm{S}$ derives $K_1$ using client's projection key $\hp$, its own $C'$ and $r'$. 
Similarly, $\bm{S}$ derives $K_2$ using its own hashing key $\hk'$ and received client's CS ciphertext $C$ that encrypts $g_1^\pi$, whereas $\bm{C}$ derives $K_2$ using server's projection key $\hp'$, its own $C$ and $r$. Security of this VPAKE protocol follows from the security of the generic scheme.
