\chapter*{Abstract}
The work at hand gives an introduction on password-based cryptography, \ie password-based authentication.
In addition to a broad overview on password related research in cryptography we give a brief introduction to provable security and the techniques used in our field.
The main part of this work however summarises findings of three research papers (given in the appendix).
In particular, we introduce oblivious \acl{PAKE} that allows clients to use multiple passwords (if he is unsure which the correct one is) in an password-based authentication protocol to authenticate to a server (that knows the correct one).
We further discuss a popular game-based security model for \ac{PAKE} protocols in with regard to forward-secrecy.
Finally, we propose a new two-server \ac{PAKE} framework using the new notion of distributed \aclp{SPHF} and conclude this work with an outlook on expected results of work currently in progress and prospective projects.
