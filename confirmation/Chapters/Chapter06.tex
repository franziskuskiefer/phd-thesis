\begin{itemize}
	\item password policy checker
	\item 2PASS (original intention of before 2PAKE)
	\item System paper on PAKE as drop-in replacement for TLS-based approach
\end{itemize}

\section{Overall Topics of my PhD}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Secure online Login with passwords (practical aspects)
	\item Security against malicious servers (opake, 2pake, 2pass, policy checker)
	\item Better understanding of security models
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The overall topic of my PhD is password-based authentication.
Thereby I tackle the following challenges
\begin{itemize}
	\item deploying PAKE for website login
	\item security against malicious servers
	\item user challenges
	\item understanding of password-based security models
\end{itemize}
