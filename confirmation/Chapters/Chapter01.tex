\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
%************************************************
This work at hand is concerned with cryptography from low-entropy secrets, better known as \emph{passwords}.
In contrast to conventional cryptographic algorithms and protocols, secrets have low-entropy here, such that an adversary is able to iterate through all possible secrets in reasonable time.
This leads directly to the inherent threat to everything we are dealing with in this work: dictionary attacks.
So why do we want to perform cryptography with passwords at all, when they comprise intrinsic attack possibilities?

\begin{quote}
``Humans are incapable of securely storing high-quality cryptographic keys, and they have unacceptable speed and accuracy when performing cryptographic operations.''~\cite{Kaufmann02}
\end{quote}

\noindent
We do not care about humans lack of speed and accuracy in performing cryptographic operations in this work.
But their inability to remember high-quality cryptographic keys is a major problem.
Even though there exist several standardized authentication tokens for humans, we heavily rely on passwords.
In general we distinguish between three big categories of authentication data \cite{Burr11}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Something you know (\eg password, \ac{PIN})
	\item Something you have (\eg mobile phone, cryptographic key)
	\item Something you are (\eg fingerprint)
\end{itemize}
But since everything someone has or is may be stolen or duplicated, knowledge (of a password) is a very important factor in authenticating a human (as long as he doe not write down his passwords).
To perform cryptography where humans input a known secret those have to be human-memorable.
This leads to the necessity of password-based cryptography as everything humans are able to remember correctly is rather short and has not much entropy.

\section{Password Based Cryptography}
Password based cryptography can be classified (with some exceptions) as symmetric within the field of cryptographic research.
In contrast to other cryptographic mechanisms where \emph{keys} are chosen from a \emph{key space}, \emph{passwords} are chosen from a \emph{dictionary}.
Note that dictionaries in our case denote sets of characters rather than \emph{real} lexicon like dictionaries.
When talking about those we use the term \emph{lexicon}.
Even though password is the the umbrella term, we distinguish between several types of passwords, we discuss in the following.

\paragraph{Passwords}
Passwords are usually chosen from a dictionary that consists of alpha-numeric characters \texttt{a-z,A-Z,0-9} and special characters like \texttt{\$,\%,@} and so on.
While many (online) services have password policies\fk{Cite password policy papers} in place, humans tend to choose easy memorable and therefore mainly easy to guess passwords that can be found in a lexicon.

\paragraph{\acc{PIN}}
\acp{PIN} are chosen from the numeric dictionary containing only the numbers \texttt{0-9}.
Furthermore, they are mainly rather short, \eg banking \acp{PIN} with four digits.

\paragraph{\acc{OTP}}
While other passwords are meant to be memorized by humans, \acp{OTP} are used only once and therefore don not have to be memorized.
\acp{OTP} have become more popular recently as a second factor in multi factor authentication.\fk{Cite google, fb, etc.}
The most popular standards for \ac{OTP}, implemented \eg in the Google Authenticator App\fk{Cite}, are the \ac{HMAC} based algorithm specified in RFC 4226\fk{cite} and the time based algorithm specified in RFC 6238\fk{cite}.

\paragraph{\acc{TAN}}
Transaction bound passwords

\subsection{The inherent Threat of Dictionary Attacks}
Most cryptographic mechanisms use high-entropy secrets such that it is impossible for anyone (any algorithm) to traverse all possible secrets from the particular secret space in tolerable time.
Password based schemes in contrast assume low-entropy secrets that are drawn from a polynomial sized dictionary.
Therefore, it is feasible for any program to walk through the entire dictionary and just try every possible secret (password).
This kind of attack is called \emph{dictionary attack} and is inherent to every password based algorithm.
There exist several approach to deal with this flaw in each specific field of password based research.
We will point out the particular mechanism when dealing with each field.

In addition to a brute force dictionary attack that iterates an entire dictionary, it is often sufficient to perform a lexicon attack that traverses only \eg words of the English language.

\paragraph{Poorly Chosen Passwords}
While dictionary attacks are unavoidable, poorly chosen passwords worsen the situation.

\section{Outline}

\paragraph{Outline of this Work}
This work consists of ??? chapters.
We gave a motivational overview on low-entropy cryptography and passwords already and deepen this discussion in the remainder of this introduction.
While the introduction stays informal in most points, the subsequent Chapter \ref{ch:background} on the background of low-entropy cryptography complete the information on research in this area, necessary for the reminder of this work.

\paragraph{Outline of this Chapter}
In the following section  we will discuss different research areas in the general field of password based cryptography.
We start with password based authentication and key exchange protocols, which comprise a big part of password based cryptography.
The second part is concerned with general cryptographic primitives from low entropy secrets and other password based protocols.
We finally conclude this chapter with an overview of mechanisms to ease or avoid problems related with password mechanisms.

\section{On Provable Security}
In this section we discuss general security models used in the field of provable security, and more specialised methods used in password based cryptography.
To prove a cryptographic primitive secure, reductionist arguments are used.
Therefore, it is tried to reduce the security of the primitive under consideration to a problem that is believed to be hard\footnote{Note that this work is not concerned with the question whether specific problems are actual hard. We consider only well investigated problems, which the cryptography community beliefs are hard.}.
Thus, as long as the underlying problem is actually hard to solve, one could be confident that the primitive is secure.
For a insightful discussion on this kind of security verification we refer to the \myhref{http://anotherlook.ca/}{``Another Look''} series by Koblitz and Menezes.

Cryptographic primitives can not be proven secure without taking into account the ability of the adversary.
Therefore, before being able to proof anything, a primitive has to be modelled.
It has always be kept in mind that the resulting proof is only valid for the used model.
There are basically two different ways of modelling: game based modelling and real world / ideal world modelling.

\subsection{Game Based Security}
The Find-then-Guess PAKE model from~\cite{Bellare2000}, strengthened and simplified in~\cite{Abdalla2005} towards the Real-or-Random PAKE model aims at Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE)-security, the main security property of PAKE protocols.

% Section: Password Based Authentication and Key Exchange
% *****************************************************************************

\section{Password Based Authentication and Key Exchange}
In this section we give a broad overview on password based authentication and key exchange protocols found in literature.
We start with the most popular protocol \emph{\ac{PAKE}} before investigating more specialized protocol classes like threshold \ac{PAKE} or group \ac{PAKE}.

\subsection{Password Based Authenticated Key Exchange}
The notion of \emph{\ac{PAKE}} was introduced by Bellovin~\cite{bellovin92} and corresponding security models were initially developed by Bellare, Pointcheval, and Rogaway~\cite{Bellare2000}, Boyko, MacKenzie, and Patel~\cite{Boyko2000}, and Goldreich and Lindell~\cite{Goldreich01}.
Until now, numerous subsequent work explored it in depth.
\ac{PAKE} allows two parties, holding low-entropy keys, to negotiate a common session key.
Despite the key exchange functionality it authenticates the two parties explicitly or implicitly.
They aim to protect against offline dictionary attacks but require restriction on the number of failed password trials as all password based protocols.
The most promising application of \ac{PAKE} protocols is the online authentication of users.
It is considered as a more secure alternative to the nowadays mainly deployed approach of transmitting the password over a secure channel (\ac{HTTPS}) and let the server perform a check against his stored credential.
The standard model of \ac{PAKE} does not require any \ac{PKI}, which is necessary for the secure channel, and assumes that only a low-entropy secret, \ie a human memorable password, is shared between both parties.
Thereby, \ac{PAKE} protocols solve the problem of potential password leakage, inherent to the approach based on secure channels.

In general, all PAKE models (see~\cite{Pointcheval2012} for a recent overview) take into account unavoidable online dictionary attacks and aim to guarantee security against offline dictionary attacks.
While many PAKE constructions require a constant number of communication rounds~\cite{Gennaro2003,Abdalla2005,Gennaro2008,Katz2009a,Katz2011}; recent frameworks by Katz and Vaikuntanathan \cite{Katz2011} and Benhamouda et al. \cite{Benhamouda2013} offer optimal one-round PAKE.

In addition to the aforementioned approaches that are tailored to the password-based setting there exist several more general authentication and key exchange frameworks such as~\cite{Camenisch2010,Blazy2012} that also lend themselves to the constructions of (somewhat less practical) PAKE protocols.
\fk[inline]{SPEKE \cite{Jablon96}}

\paragraph{Game-Based \acc{PAKE}-Security}
The original game-based \ac{PAKE} models in~\cite{Bellare2000,Boyko2000} incorporate the \ac{FtG} approach where the semantic security of the session key is considered with respect to one particular session, referred to as a \emph{test session}, determined by the adversary through one call to a \Test oracle.
Abdalla, Fouque, and Pointcheval~\cite{Abdalla2005} defined a \ac{RoR} approach to model semantic security of PAKE protocols by allowing polynomially-many queries to a \Test oracle.
They showed not only that their \ac{RoR} approach leads to stronger security but were also able to simplify the model by removing the \Reveal oracle that provides the adversary with established session keys.
The adversary in~\cite{Abdalla2005} is thus left with access to the \Test oracle, the \Execute oracle that models passive attacks, and the \Send oracle accounting for active attacks.

The models in~\cite{Bellare2000,Abdalla2005} remain the most popular game-based PAKE models, adopted in the analysis of many protocols, including the random oracle-based protocols~\cite{Abdalla2006,Abdalla2005b} and protocols requiring a common reference string (CRS)~\cite{Gennaro2003,Gennaro2008,Katz2009a}.

\paragraph{Simulation-Based \acc{PAKE}-Security}
Simultaneously with the first game-based models in \cite{Bellare2000,Boyko2000}, the first simulation-based \ac{PAKE} model has been proposed by Goldreich and Lindell~\cite{Goldreich01}.
Their work also comprises the only (but fairly inefficient) protocol that is built from general secure multi-party computation techniques but does not require any setup assumptions nor random oracles.
The protocol has been subsequently simplified at the cost of weakened security in~\cite{NguyenV04}.
While the model from \cite{Goldreich01} is hardly used in the analysis of \ac{PAKE} protocols, a stronger simulation-based model in the framework of Universal Composability (UC)~\cite{Canetti2001a} has been proposed by Canetti, Halevi, Katz and Lindell~\cite{Canetti2005} later.
In contrast to game-based \ac{PAKE} protocols, UC-secure protocols require setup assumptions, with CRS being the most popular one~\cite{Katz2011}, albeit ideal ciphers / random oracles~\cite{Abdalla2008} and stronger hardware-based assumptions~\cite{cryptoeprint:2012:537} have also been used.

%This bundle for \LaTeX\ has two goals:
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Provide students with an easy-to-use template for their
%    Master's
%    or PhD thesis. (Though it might also be used by other types of
%    authors
%    for reports, books, etc.)
%    \item Provide a classic, high-quality typographic style that is
%    inspired by \citeauthor{bringhurst:2002}'s ``\emph{The Elements of
%    Typographic Style}'' \citep{bringhurst:2002}.
%    \marginpar{\myTitle \myVersion}
%\end{enumerate}
%The bundle is configured to run with a \emph{full} 
%MiK\TeX\ or \TeX Live\footnote{See the file \texttt{LISTOFFILES} for
%needed packages. Furthermore, \texttt{classicthesis} 
%works with most other distributions and, thus, with most systems 
%\LaTeX\ is available for.} 
%installation right away and, therefore, it uses only freely available 
%fonts. (Minion fans can easily adjust the style to their needs.)
%
%People interested only in the nice style and not the whole bundle can
%now use the style stand-alone via the file \texttt{classicthesis.sty}.
%This works now also with ``plain'' \LaTeX.
%
%As of version 3.0, \texttt{classicthesis} can also be easily used with 
%\mLyX\footnote{\url{http://www.lyx.org}} thanks to Nicholas Mariette 
%and Ivo Pletikosi\'c. The \mLyX\ version of this manual will contain
%more information on the details.
%
%This should enable anyone with a basic knowledge of \LaTeXe\ or \mLyX\ to
%produce beautiful documents without too much effort. In the end, this
%is my overall goal: more beautiful documents, especially theses, as I
%am tired of seeing so many ugly ones.
%
%The whole template and the used style is released under the
%\textsmaller{GNU} General Public License. 
%
%If you like the style then I would appreciate a postcard:
%\begin{center}
% André Miede \\
% Detmolder Straße 32 \\
% 31737 Rinteln \\
% Germany
%\end{center}
%The postcards I received so far are available at:

%\marginpar{A well-balanced line width improves the legibility of

%So far, many theses, some books, and several other publications have

%% \citep{bringhurst:2002}.
%
%\paragraph{Important Note:} Some things of this style might look
%unusual at first glance, many people feel so in the beginning.
%However, all things are intentionally designed to be as they are,
%especially these:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item No bold fonts are used. Italics or spaced small caps do the
%    job quite well.
%    \item The size of the text body is intentionally shaped like it
%    is. It supports both legibility and allows a reasonable amount of
%    information to be on a page. And, no: the lines are not too short.
%    \item The tables intentionally do not use vertical or double
%    rules. See the documentation for the \texttt{booktabs} package for
%    a nice discussion of this topic.\footnote{To be found online at \\
%    \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/}.}
%    \item And last but not least, to provide the reader with a way
%    easier access to page numbers in the table of contents, the page
%    numbers are right behind the titles. Yes, they are \emph{not}
%    neatly aligned at the right side and they are \emph{not} connected
%    with dots that help the eye to bridge a distance that is not
%    necessary. If you are still not convinced: is your reader
%    interested in the page number or does she want to sum the numbers
%    up?
%\end{itemize}
%Therefore, please do not break the beauty of the style by changing
%these things unless you really know what you are doing! Please.
%
%
%\section{Organization}
%A very important factor for successful thesis writing is the
%organization of the material. This template suggests a structure as
%the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \marginpar{You can use these margins for summaries of the text
%    body\dots}
%    \item\texttt{Chapters/} is where all the ``real'' content goes in
%    separate files such as \texttt{Chapter01.tex} etc.
% %  \item\texttt{Examples/} is where you store all listings and other
% %  examples you want to use for your text.
%    \item\texttt{FrontBackMatter/} is where all the stuff goes that
%    surrounds the ``real'' content, such as the acknowledgments,
%    dedication, etc.
%    \item\texttt{gfx/} is where you put all the graphics you use in
%    the thesis. Maybe they should be organized into subfolders
%    depending on the chapter they are used in, if you have a lot of
%    graphics.
%    \item\texttt{Bibliography.bib}: the Bib\TeX\ database to organize
%    all the references you might want to cite.
%    \item\texttt{classicthesis.sty}: the style definition to get this
%    awesome look and feel. Does not only work with this thesis template
%    but also on its own (see folder \texttt{Examples}). Bonus: works
%    with both \LaTeX\ and \textsc{pdf}\LaTeX\dots and \mLyX.
%    \item\texttt{ClassicThesis.tcp} a \TeX nicCenter project file.
%    Great tool and it's free!
%    \item\texttt{ClassicThesis.tex}: the main file of your thesis
%    where all gets bundled together.
%    \item\texttt{classicthesis-config.tex}: a central place to load all 
%    nifty packages that are used. In there, you can also activate 
%    backrefs in order to have information in the bibliography about 
%    where a source was cited in the text (\ie, the page number).
%    
%    \emph{Make your changes and adjustments here.} This means that you  
%    specify here the options you want to load \texttt{classicthesis.sty} 
%    with. You also adjust the title of your thesis, your name, and all 
%    similar information here. Refer to \autoref{sec:custom} for more 
%    information.
%    
%		This had to change as of version 3.0 in order to enable an easy 
%		transition from the ``basic'' style to \mLyX.
%    
%\end{itemize}
%In total, this should get you started in no time.
%
%
%\section{Style Options}\label{sec:options}
%There are a couple of options for \texttt{classicthesis.sty} that
%allow for a bit of freedom concerning the layout:
%\marginpar{\dots or your supervisor might use the margins for some
%    comments of her own while reading.}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item General:
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item\texttt{drafting}: prints the date and time at the bottom of
%    each page, so you always know which version you are dealing with.
%    Might come in handy not to give your Prof. that old draft.
%		\end{itemize}
%	
%	\item Parts and Chapters:
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item\texttt{parts}: if you use Part divisions for your document,
%    you should choose this option. (Cannot be used together with 
%    \texttt{nochapters}.)
%    
%			\item\texttt{nochapters}: allows to use the look-and-feel with 
%    classes that do not use chapters, \eg, for articles. Automatically
%    turns off a couple of other options: \texttt{eulerchapternumbers}, 
%    \texttt{linedheaders}, \texttt{listsseparated}, and \texttt{parts}. 
%    
%	    \item\texttt{linedheaders}: changes the look of the chapter
%	    headings a bit by adding a horizontal line above the chapter
%	    title. The chapter number will also be moved to the top of the
%	    page, above the chapter title.
%    
%		\end{itemize}
%
%  \item Typography:
%		\begin{itemize}
%				\item\texttt{eulerchapternumbers}: use figures from Hermann Zapf's
%    Euler math font for the chapter numbers. By default, old style
%    figures from the Palatino font are used.
%    
%        \item\texttt{beramono}: loads Bera Mono as typewriter font. 
%    (Default setting is using the standard CM typewriter font.)
%    \item\texttt{eulermath}: loads the awesome Euler fonts for math. 
%    (Palatino is used as default font.)
%    
%		    \item\texttt{pdfspacing}: makes use of pdftex' letter spacing
%		    capabilities via the \texttt{microtype} package.\footnote{Use 
%		    \texttt{microtype}'s \texttt{DVIoutput} option to generate
%		    DVI with pdftex.} This fixes some serious issues regarding 
%		    math formul\ae\ etc. (\eg, ``\ss'') in headers. 
%		    
%		    \item\texttt{minionprospacing}: uses the internal \texttt{textssc}
%		    command of the \texttt{MinionPro} package for letter spacing. This 
%		    automatically enables the \texttt{minionpro} option and overrides
%		    the \texttt{pdfspacing} option.
%    
%		\end{itemize}  
%
%	\item Table of Contents:
%		\begin{itemize}
%			 \item\texttt{tocaligned}: aligns the whole table of contents on
%		    the left side. Some people like that, some don't.
%		    
%		    \item\texttt{dottedtoc}: sets pagenumbers flushed right in the 
%		    table of contents.
%
%			\item\texttt{manychapters}: if you need more than nine chapters for 
%	    your document, you might not be happy with the spacing between the 
%	    chapter number and the chapter title in the Table of Contents. 
%	    This option allows for additional space in this context. 
%	    However, it does not look as ``perfect'' if you use
%	    \verb|\parts| for structuring your document.
%		    
%		\end{itemize}
%    
%	\item Floats:
%		\begin{itemize}
%    \item\texttt{listings}: loads the \texttt{listings} package (if not 
%    already done) and configures the List of Listings accordingly.
%    
%    \item\texttt{floatperchapter}: activates numbering per chapter for
%    all floats such as figures, tables, and listings (if used).	
%    
%	    \item\texttt{subfig}(\texttt{ure}): is passed to the \texttt{tocloft} 
%	    package to enable compatibility with the \texttt{subfig}(\texttt{ure}) 
%	    package. Use this option if you want use classicthesis with the
%	    \texttt{subfig} package.
%    	
%%    \item\texttt{listsseparated}: will add extra space between table
%%    and figure entries of different chapters in the list of tables or
%%    figures, respectively. % Deprecated as of version 2.9.
%		\end{itemize}    
% 
%% 	\item\texttt{a5paper}: adjusts the page layout according to the
%%    global \texttt{a5paper} option (\emph{experimental} feature).
%%    \item\texttt{minionpro}: sets Robert Slimbach's Minion as the 
%%    main font of the document. The textblock size is adjusted 
%%    accordingly.    
%
%   \end{itemize}
%The best way to figure these options out is to try the different
%possibilities and see, what you and your supervisor like best.
%
%In order to make things easier in general, 
%\texttt{classicthesis-config.tex} 
%contains some useful commands that might help you.
%
%
%\section{Customization}\label{sec:custom}
%%(As of v3.0, the Classic Thesis Style for \LaTeX{} and \mLyX{} share
%%the same two \texttt{.sty} files.)
%This section will give you some hints about how to adapt 
%\texttt{classicthesis} to your needs.
%
%The file \texttt{classicthesis.sty}
%contains the core functionality of the style and in most cases will
%be left intact, whereas the file \texttt{classic\-thesis-config.tex}
%is used for some common user customizations. 
%
%The first customization you are about to make is to alter the document
%title, author name, and other thesis details. In order to do this, replace
%the data in the following lines of \texttt{classicthesis-config.tex:}%
%\marginpar{Modifications in \texttt{classic\-thesis-config.tex}%
%}
%
%\begin{lstlisting}[frame=lt]
%% **************************************************
%% 2. Personal data and user ad-hoc commands
%% **************************************************
%\newcommand{\myTitle}{A Classic Thesis Style\xspace} 
%\newcommand{\mySubtitle}{An Homage to...\xspace} 
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%Further customization can be made in \texttt{classicthesis-config.tex}
%by choosing the options to \texttt{classicthesis.sty} 
%(see~\autoref{sec:options}) in a line that looks like this:
%
%\begin{lstlisting}[frame=lt]
%\PassOptionsToPackage{eulerchapternumbers,drafting,listings,subfig,eulermath,parts}{classicthesis}
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%If you want to use backreferences from your citations to the pages
%they were cited on, change the following line from:
%\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=false,frame=lt]
%\setboolean{enable-backrefs}{false} % true false
%\end{lstlisting}
%to
%\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=false,frame=lt]
%\setboolean{enable-backrefs}{true} % true false
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%Many other customizations in \texttt{classicthesis-config.tex} are
%possible, but you should be careful making changes there, since some
%changes could cause errors.
%
%Finally, changes can be made in the file \texttt{classicthesis.sty},%
%\marginpar{Modifications in \texttt{classicthesis.sty}%
%} although this is mostly not designed for user customization. The
%main change that might be made here is the text-block size, for example,
%to get longer lines of text.

%\subsection*{Compatibility with the \texttt{pdfsync} Package}
%Using the \texttt{pdfsync} package leads to linebreaking problems with the \texttt{graffito} command. 
%Thanks to Henrik Schumacher for this information. 
%

%
%\section{Future Work}
%So far, this is a quite stable version that served a couple of people
%well during their thesis time. However, some things are still not as
%they should be. Proper documentation in the standard format is still
%missing. In the long run, the style should probably be published
%separately, with the template bundle being only an application of the
%style. Alas, there is no time for that at the moment\dots it could be
%a nice task for a small group of \LaTeX nicians.
%
%Please do not send me email with questions concerning \LaTeX\ or the
%template, as I do not have time for an answer. But if you have
%comments, suggestions, or improvements for the style or the template
%in general, do not hesitate to write them on that postcard of yours.
%
%
%\section{Beyond a Thesis}
%It is easy to use the layout of \texttt{classicthesis.sty} without the
%framework of this bundle. To make it even easier, this section offers 
%some plug-and-play-examples.
%
%The \LaTeX -sources of these examples can be found in the folder 
%with the name \texttt{Examples}. They have been tested with  
%\texttt{latex} and \texttt{pdflatex} and are easy to compile. To 
%assure you even a bit more, PDFs built from the sources can also 
%be found in the folder. 
%%(It might be necessary to adjust the path to 
%%\texttt{classicthesis.sty} and \texttt{Bibliography.bib} within the 
%%examples.)
