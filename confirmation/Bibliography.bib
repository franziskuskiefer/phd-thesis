	subscription services, and shopping, there is growing concern about
	identity theft. When people reuse their passwords across multiple
	accounts, they increase their vulnerability; compromising one password
	can help an attacker take over several accounts. Our study of 49
	undergraduates quantifies how many passwords they had and how often
	they reused these passwords. The majority of users had three or fewer
	passwords and passwords were reused twice. Furthermore, over time,
	password reuse rates increased because people accumulated more accounts
	but did not create more passwords. Users justified their habits.
	While they wanted to protect financial data and personal communication,
	reusing passwords made passwords easier to manage. Users visualized
	threats from human attackers, particularly viewing those close to
	them as the most motivated and able attackers; however, participants
	did not separate the human attackers from their potentially automated
	tools. They sometimes failed to realize that personalized passwords
	such as phone numbers can be cracked given a large enough dictionary
	and enough tries. We discuss how current systems support poor password
	practices. We also present potential changes in website authentication
	systems and password managers.},
